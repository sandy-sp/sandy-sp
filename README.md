# Hey there! I'm Sandeep Paidipati ðŸ‘‹

I'm an **AI-Driven Developer** crafting open-source solutions with **Generative AI**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Python**. Originally a web designer, I pivoted to AI through self-directed learning, mastering tools related to AI like **ChatGPT**, **Grok**, **Ollama**, and **Hugging Face Transformers**. Iâ€™m passionate about data visualization, real-world problem-solving, and collaborating on impactful projects. Outside of code, I enjoy chess, landscape photography, and aqua scaping fuels my tech journey!
